#Worksheet 5 - Do chapter 3 of online R tutorial http://tryr.codeschool.com/1. How could you make a matrix that is 5 columns wide and 2 rows deep and that has the value 1 in each cell? 	```matrix(1, 2, 5)```2. How could you make a matrix that is 2 wide and 2 deep and that has the values 10, 14, 20 and 30 in it? 	```a = c(10, 14, 20, 30)``` 	```matrix(a, 2, 2)```3. What does the dim assignment function do to a vector? 	It allows you to change the dimensions of a vector.4. This chapter is about matrices. Can you think of data that would come in the form of a matrix? Remember that in a matrix, all cells have the same datatype. 	Ground elevation data comes in the form of a matrix. 5. You learned three commands to plot a matrix. Which are they? Which one do you think would be most useful? 	contour()		persp()		image() 	I think image might be the most useful because heat maps are used for gene expression data.**Finished!** Name: Date:  ***
#Worksheet 6: Do chapter 4 of Try R codeschool You can do all the exercises in the online tutorial first, then come back to this worksheet to answer a few questions. 1. You used about 5 functions in this tutorial.  Write down the functions and how they work. 	mean(), finds the mean/average of the values in a vector	median(), finds the median of the values in a vector	sd(), finds the standard deviation of the mean of the values in a vector	barplot(), makes bar graphs	abline(), allows you to add lines to bar graphs2. Several objects were used in this tutorial. Two of them are vectors - which ones? Which ones were simple "numeric"s? 	That data for the number of limbs and the data for the number of pounds were inside vectors.	The output of the mean and median commands are “numerics”. 3. How would you use the function abline to create a horizontal line that crosses the y-axis at 10? And a vertical line that crosses the x-axis at 10?If you want to try this out (which would be great! use Rstudio), you need to first create a plot with some data, for example:  ```x <- 1:12  y <- 1:12  
plot(x,y)  ```Now you can play with the `abline()` function to add horizontal and vertical lines. ```abline(h = 10)```	```abline(v = 10)```**Awesome! Another tutorial done!**

**Install R and RStudio prior to working on this worksheet**  #Worksheet 7 Getting to know Rstudio through videos from Udacity. If you are doing this at home, you should first install RStudio. If you are in the computer room, you can start with this worksheet. Rstudio is installed on the computers, find it in the "dock" and start the program. **Task 1.** Watch video on Rstudio basics:https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=FDSmlIBy7ko**Task 2.** Watch video on changing the settings of Rstudio (up to 45 seconds). https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=vLlj5nNj8x4**Task 3.** Change the settings for "appearance" and enjoy the new colors. **Task 4.** Watch video on getting help for Rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABVX527RODE**Task 5.** Go to the quick R website (google quick R or go to http://www.statmethods.net/). Search for information on bar plots. You'll need it for the next task. **Task 6.** Create a new R script in RstudioWrite code to make two numeric vectors of equal length, and plot them in a scatter plot.Then plot one of them in a barplot. Make the barplot horizontal. Create a matrix that combines both vectors using rbind(vector1,vector2) and create a barplot of that matrix. Save your code in a place on your computer where you can find it back.  
How to save your code in an R script: https://vimeo.com/142568715

Append/copy your .R code here as a code block i.e. enclosed in 3 backticks, e.g.:

```xvec = c(1:12) yvec = c(1:12)
plot(xvec,yvec)
barplot(xvec, horiz = TRUE)
xybind = rbind(xvec,yvec)
barplot(xybind)```

#Worksheet 8: Chapter 5 of Try R codeschool Chapter 5 is about factors. Nominal data should be stored as factors. The following are examples of data that should be stored as factors: 1. Gender (male / female / unspecified)2. Nationality (e.g., US, Canada, Mexico)3. Type of animal (e.g., dog, fish, cat, horse)4. Age if range is used (below 40, 40 or older)The following are examples of data that should not be stored as factors: 1. Age if years or months are used (numeric)2. Height (numeric)3. Price (numeric)**Task 1.** Come up with at least 4 examples of data that should be stored as factors. 1.	Gene ontology (i.e. metabolism, transcription)2.	Location (i.e. San Francisco, Sacramento)3.	Building type (apartment, house, office building)4.	Computer type (smart phone, laptop, desktop)**Task 2.** Explain all parts of the command `plot(weights, prices, pch=as.integer(types))`The “plot()” command will plot the data as a scatter plot; “weights” and “prices” are vectors with stored values; “pch” allows us to plot different plot characters for each point; “as.integer” allows us to access the integer references for the levels in a factor, and the factor being used in this case is “types”.      **On your way to becoming an R ninja!**Name:Date:
