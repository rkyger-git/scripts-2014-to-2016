Homework 2	Ryan Kyger
Due 9am, 9/15/16

Please put all your answers in a single file, with the question number followed by the whole command (beginning with “perl –e …”)

1.  Write a perl script to create a file called ‘HW2file’ containing the following information about the yeast gene YJR151W-A (the spaces are ‘tabs’:

YJR151W-A	+	chr10		717570..717620

Now run the command (create the file).

perl -e 'print “YJR151W-A	+	chr10	717570..717620”' > HW2file


2.  Write a perl script that reads in a line like the one above and prints out the strand (+ or -)

perl -e '$_ = readline; print $1 if /(.\t)+/; print "\n"' HW2file


3.  Write a perl script that reads in a line like the one above and prints out the chromosome number (i.e., whatever number is after ‘chr’)

perl -e '$_ = readline; print $1 if /chr(\d+)/; print "\n"' HW2file


4.  Write a perl script that reads in a line like the one above and prints out the gene name (whatever is the first series of non-space characters).

perl -ane 'print $F[0]; print "\n"' HW2file


5.  Write a perl script that reads in a line like the one above and prints out the beginning coordinate, a tab, and then the ending coordinate.

perl -ane 'print $F[3]; print "\n"' HW2file

Note: This code was the best I could do. My goal was replace the replace periods (..) with a tab (\t) and then tell perl to print $F[3] (output: 717570), print a tab (\t), and then print $F[4] (output: 717620). I tried 5 to 6 different ways to try to accomplish this. 


6.  How long did this assignment take you?

 ~2.5 hours
